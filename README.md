# Toonslate-Gags

## Aim 👍
This project is about getting your way into silly and nostalgic games. Be a kid you wanted to be while you immerse into this experience. Get ready for a spellbounding ride.

## Purpose 💡
It's the perfect hack to get engaged with cartoons and enjoy it to the core from the busy schedules everyone had got. This would definitely get them into thinking to provide some time for themselves and feel relieved.

## Inspiration🔆
This inspiration we had draw from the games and cartoon we grown watching it. It was really nostalgic to relieve all those memories while working on this project

## What it Does?❓❗
This is the project to get yourself immersed in nostalgic experience. We have 4 games on board along with a creative quiz to test your knowledge on cartoons. Here we had choosen Chota Bheem, Shinchan, Doraemon and Tom and Jerry. Games we had placed comprises of Sudoku, Minecraft Quest, Car  Racing and Cricket. All of these were unique on their own and completely different from each other. We awakened the kiddies in us to create this project. 

## How we built it? 💻
We had built up our games using python and cartoon quiz. It was scarry to take a leap and build it directly from a scratch as we are beginners to these kind of projects and have no prior experience on it. 

## Technicalities of the project 🛠

The project was built using python and web development skills. It can be viewed here : https://powerongirls.wixsite.com/toonslate

Thanks to GoDaddy and MLH for the Domain Name🤩

## Challenges We ran into 😱
We literally had no idea of creating the website as we are new to web development. All we had was basic knowledge on python. From doing small projects and now trying to work on full end project in shorter span was really tough. We learnt it the hard way. I understood that we cannot deploy the project directly but instead we need interfaces to make it look like a website.😢Doing all this in a weekend was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😎
Successfully built a full end project from a scratch
Did all sorts of designing and application developement in it to make this experience interactive.
Was able to finally deploy it in a better way
Also took up a catchy domain name with the help of GoDaddy: 'toonslate-gags-with.us'

## What we learned👨🏻‍🎓
Learned how to build games from scratch
Learned how to integrate html pages with project files
Learned how to create virtual interfaces to make it look interactive
Learned how to work with Github pages
Learned to resolve my application errors on my own
Learned about integrating all the files together and bringing this up into a one
Learned the process of associating domain names with our project and also linking it to Github
Overall, learnt completely about working with front end and back end. Can now build my personal full stack projects.

## What's next for Toonslate Gigs💦
I can add more such games and deploy it fully fledged for users to enter this funny ride. Also, I do have a thought of making it more versatile so that it's flexible for everyone using this interface. It would help them get out of the work race and relax for a while.
